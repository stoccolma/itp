Sicily's beds come in two kinds: comfort or character. You can't have both.

### The Agriturismo Way
You stay on a farm. Dinner grows ten meters from your chair. The owner tells you what's for lunch, not the other way around. Ricotta shows up warm; olive oil is poured like wine.

### When a Hotel Wins
In Palermo or Catania, proximity beats poetry. Sometimes an elevator is worth the price.

### The Real Divide
Hotels polish. Farms persuade. One gives you rest; the other gives you stories to tell on the flight home.
