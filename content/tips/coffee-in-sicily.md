Coffee is a transaction, not a ceremony. Walk in, nod, order *"un caffè, grazie."* No extra adjectives, no drama. It'll arrive in ten seconds, vanish in two.

### Morning Law
Cappuccino dies at 11 a.m. After that, milk is for children and tourists. Order one later and they'll serve it—with sympathy.

### How to Drink
Stand at the counter. Pay after. Speak only if spoken to. The cup is hot, the pause short, the exit unannounced.

### Granita Clause
In summer, coffee turns cold and sweet. Coffee granita with cream isn't dessert—it's breakfast for the heat.
