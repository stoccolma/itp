Driving in Sicily isn't about rules. It's about rhythm. Signs and lines are suggestions, not scripture. Learn by watching, not assuming.

### The Basics
Use your horn like punctuation. A short tap means "I'm here." A longer one means "I'm staying." Lanes split and merge without warning. Blinkers are optional decorations.

### ZTL Traps
Old towns are wrapped in **zona traffico limitato** cameras. Locals ignore them; you can't. See a red circle? Reverse your sins before it's too late.

### Parking Diplomacy
If someone waves you into a spot, they're not volunteering—they're working. Hand them a coin. It's not corruption. It's choreography.

> Confidence matters more than speed. Patience more than politeness.
