English works near monuments. Elsewhere, charm requires vowels and gestures.

### Useful Phrases
- *Un caffè, grazie* — a coffee, please  
- *Un bicchiere d'acqua* — a glass of water  
- *Dov'è il bagno?* — where's the bathroom  
- *A manca / a destra* — left / right (Sicilian / Italian)  
- *Grazzii* — thank you (Sicilian flavor intact)

### Gestures Explained
Fingers pinched and lifted? "What are you doing?"  
Twist of the index finger in the cheek? "Delicious."  
Palms out, shake once? "Enough."

### Daily Logic
Shops nap from 1–4 p.m. Smile often. Tip lightly. Complain never. Sicily forgives confusion, not arrogance.
