Ortigia is a stage built for everyday life. Lanes tilt toward the water. Laundry draws lines across alleys. Stone keeps the heat steady. The island is not large, which is the whole point.

## Morning Market
Follow the sound before you follow a map. Stalls hold lemons with their leaves still on, jars of anchovies in oil, capers by the scoop, and swordfish heads that look back at you without apology. Buy what you understand. Ask for a small tasting of something you do not. You will be shown how to eat it within seconds.

## The Quiet Circuit
Start at **Fonte Aretusa** where ducks pretend to own the place. Walk the sea wall past the platforms where people swim between errands. Turn inward to **Piazza Duomo**. The curve of the square is a lesson in restraint. Baroque here is confident but not smug. Sit for a coffee and let the square pass by you at the speed of parents and kids.

## Simple Rules That Work
- Eat early when the wind is from the north. The air carries salt and sharpens flavor.  
- Do not plan too far ahead. The best table will appear when someone waves you over.  
- Bring a bag for small food shopping. The market is not a museum.

> "You do not visit Ortigia," a fishmonger said when asked for directions. "You pass through it slowly."

### If You Go
- **Swim:** Platforms along the rocks near **Lungomare Alfeo**.  
- **Evening:** A glass of **Etna Bianco** with anything salty.  
- **Side trip:** The **Neapolis** archaeological park for a change of scale.
