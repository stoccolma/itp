On Stromboli the mountain is not a view. It is a neighbor with habits. Every so often it clears its throat and sends a reminder into the sky. People set the table anyway.

## Getting There
The hydrofoil from **Milazzo** is the normal route. The crossing is simple when the weather cooperates and not worth arguing with when it does not. Pack shoes that forgive rock and ash. Pack layers. The wind changes its mind often.

## The Sciara del Fuoco
At night boats gather where they can watch without intruding. Ribbons of orange slide down a flank of black. The sea holds still for a few moments, and everyone goes quiet even if they did not plan to. This is not drama for tourists. It is a cycle that predates whatever you brought in your bag.

## Eat What Is There
Seafood is not a theme here. It is dinner. **Spaghetti alle vongole** works because the clams came off a boat that morning and because no one tries to complicate them. Grilled fish is seasoned the way a fisherman seasons it. Oil, salt, heat, done.

> "When it is noisy, the mountain is healthy," a boatman told me while tying a knot I could not follow.

### If You Go
- **Base:** Stromboli town near the church of **San Vincenzo**.  
- **Walk:** Lava sand beaches toward **Piscità** for sunset.  
- **Respect:** Trails close for safety. If a sign says closed, it is not a debate.  
- **Always:** Carry water. Light on paths. Patience at ports.
