Modica lives in two valleys with churches stacked like steps. It also lives inside a bar of chocolate that ignores everything industrial. Here, cocoa is milled on stone. The temperature stays low. The sugar never fully disappears. It is not a mistake. It is the point.

## A City Built for Uphill
From **Modica Bassa** to **Modica Alta**, the town feels tight and vertical. Balconies lean toward each other and share news across the street. Stairs cut through walls. At night the city is a warm hillside constellation.

## The Chocolate Houses
**Antica Dolceria Bonajuto** is the name most people know, but it is not the only workshop. What matters is the method. Cocoa and sugar meet without extra fats. The result is a bar that breaks with a dry snap and then melts slowly, leaving small crystals that brighten the flavor. Flavors rotate. Cinnamon works. Peperoncino works. Citrus works when it is real and not perfume.

> "We keep the stones and the heat low. The rest is patience," said a chocolatier who did not want his name in print.

## How to Taste
Do not rush through a checklist. Buy two small bars and eat them on a bench. Let the bar warm a little in your hand. Break a piece. Notice the texture and the way it clears the palate instead of coating it. If you want more, you will know.

## Between Bites
- **San Giorgio.** The steps are steep, the view honest.  
- **Street food.** A warm **scaccia** layered with cheese and tomato is a local answer to hunger that arrives without warning.  
- **Side trip.** **Ragusa Ibla** is near and wears its stone differently. If you like to compare, go.

### If You Go
- **Time:** Give Modica half a day and the evening.  
- **Buy:** Two bars to carry. Heat is the enemy.  
- **Drink:** Water or a dry white. Sweet wine fights with the chocolate.
